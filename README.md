# viz-template
The general direction that I am planning on taking this visualization is to make it more interactive. There are the general hover features and shiny input features that allow for the audience to filter the dataset.  I am currently working on trying to figure out if it is possible for a person to click on a state polygon and for that to be a method for the audience to filter by state which would then provide more polygons that represent individual representatives and provide voting behavior(?) or general demographics. I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions you have to offer.
